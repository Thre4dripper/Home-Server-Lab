### üîß Adding New Services

We're always looking to expand our collection of self-hosted services! Before adding a new service:

1. **Check if the service is already planned** in our issues
2. **Ensure the service is actively maintained** by its developers
3. **Verify it works well on ARM64** (Raspberry Pi compatibility)
4. **Confirm it's genuinely useful** for home lab environments

## üèóÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of containerization
- Familiarity with YAML and shell scripting

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Home-Server-Lab.git
   cd Home-Server-Lab
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/service-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

### Testing Environment

- Test on actual hardware when possible (Raspberry Pi recommended)
- Use virtual machines for initial development
- Test resource consumption and performance
- Verify services work after system reboot

## üì¶ Adding New Services

### Service Structure

Each service must follow this standardized structure:

```
service-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Comprehensive service documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml     # Main container configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example          # Configuration template with examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh              # Automated deployment script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore            # Exclude sensitive data and logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                 # Persistent data directory (created by setup)
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Create service directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir service-name
   cd service-name
   ```

2. **Create docker-compose.yml:**
   - Use official Docker images when available
   - Implement proper health checks
   - Use bind mounts for data persistence
   - Configure resource limits
   - Use internal networks for security

3. **Create .env.example:**
   - Include all configurable parameters
   - Provide sensible defaults
   - Add security warnings for sensitive values
   - Document each variable clearly

4. **Write setup.sh script:**
   - Check for prerequisites
   - Validate configuration
   - Create necessary directories
   - Pull images and start services
   - Provide post-deployment instructions

5. **Create comprehensive README.md** (see Documentation Guidelines)

6. **Create .gitignore:**
   - Exclude `.env` files
   - Exclude `data/` directories
   - Exclude logs and temporary files

### Example Service Template

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  service-name:
    image: official/service-name:latest
    container_name: service-name
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${SERVICE_PORT:-8080}:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./config:/app/config
    environment:
      - ENV_VAR=${ENV_VAR:-default_value}
    networks:
      - service-net
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    mem_limit: 512m
    cpus: 0.5

networks:
  service-net:
    driver: bridge
```

## üìè Service Standards

### Configuration Requirements

- **Environment Variables**: All configuration through `.env` files
- **Data Persistence**: Use bind mounts to `./data/` directory
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits
- **Health Checks**: Implement proper health check endpoints
- **Security**: No hardcoded passwords or secrets
- **Networking**: Use internal Docker networks when possible

### Performance Requirements

- **ARM64 Compatibility**: Must work on Raspberry Pi 4
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize for single-board computers
- **Startup Time**: Services should start within 2 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: Document expected memory consumption
- **Storage**: Minimize disk space requirements

### Security Requirements

- **No Root Privileges**: Avoid running containers as root when possible
- **Secret Management**: Sensitive data only in `.env` files
- **Network Security**: Minimal exposed ports
- **Update Policy**: Use specific version tags, not `latest`
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Check for known security issues
